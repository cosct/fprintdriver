/*
 * EgisTec EH575 matcher: port of the Windows-engine replica validated in
 * the fprintdriver research project. The Python reference lives in
 * scripts/egis_matcher.py; provenance of the extracted coefficients is
 * documented in docs/windows-engine-tables.md, both at
 * https://github.com/cosct/fprintdriver
 *
 * Pipeline: flat-field → 11-orientation ridge matched filter bank (taps
 * extracted from EgisTouchFPEngine0575.dll) → interest points on filter
 * response → 512-bit orientation-histogram descriptors (DLL pyramid
 * weights) → Hamming NN + translation-cluster + angle-mode scoring.
 *
 * Pure C, no GLib: also compiled into the standalone cross-validation
 * harness (tools/egis0575-matcher-test.c).

/* Verdict thresholds. The C engine's descriptor bits differ slightly from

 * interpolation path in the oriented filter), so its score scale differs.
 *
 * Recalibrated 2026-09-13 on 23 verify-run datasets (125 probes) after the
 * orientation-4 FIR kernel and tie-break fixes changed the score scale.
 * Verdicts are run-level (up to 6 probes per press, any passing probe
 * suffices): confident-genuine runs bottomed at a max probe score of 349,
 * confident-impostor runs peaked at 288 (including ambiguous runs: 321).
 * Threshold 335 sits at the midpoint of that gap; agree floor 150 × 2
