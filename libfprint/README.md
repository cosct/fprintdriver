# libfprint-egis0575

This repository is upstream [libfprint](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/libfprint/libfprint)
plus **`egis0575`**, an experimental driver for the **EgisTec EH575 (LighTuning,
USB 1c7a:0575)** swipe/capacitive-press fingerprint sensor found in several
Acer/Wortmann machines.

- Driver branch: **`egis0575`** (default branch here); `master` tracks upstream untouched.
- Architecture: press-snapshot capture (103×52 frames, warm-background
  subtraction, quality gate) ported from the EH577 driver, with topni1's
  calibration init (required on EH575) and a host-side matcher ported from
  the vendor Windows engine (11-orientation ridge matched-filter bank,
  512-bit descriptors, Hamming/RANSAC scoring; coefficients extracted from
  EgisTouchFPEngine0575.dll). See `libfprint/drivers/egis0575.c` header
  comment for details and the
  [fprintdriver research repo](https://github.com/cosct/libfprint-egis0575)
  for the full protocol analysis and matcher validation.
- Status: works for KDE lock-screen / `fprintd` unlock on the developer's
  machine; tuning thresholds and feedback from other EH575 owners welcome
  (open a GitHub issue).
- Arch Linux users: install **`libfprint-egis0575`** from the AUR.
- License: LGPL-2.1-or-later, same as upstream. Contributions upstream are
  the long-term goal.

## History

**LibFPrint** was originally developed as part of an
academic project at the **[University Of Manchester]**.

It aimed to hide the differences between consumer
fingerprint scanners and provide a single uniform
API to application developers.

## Goal

The ultimate goal of the **FPrint** project is to make
fingerprint scanners widely and easily usable under
common Linux environments.

## License

`Section 6` of the license states that for compiled works that use
this library, such works must include **LibFPrint** copyright notices
alongside the copyright notices for the other parts of the work.

**LibFPrint** includes code from **NIST's** **[NBIS]** software distribution.

We include **Bozorth3** from the **[US Export Controlled]**
distribution, which we have determined to be fine
being shipped in an open source project.
